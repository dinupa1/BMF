# Utilizing Deep Neural Networks for the Extraction of Drell-Yan Angular Coefficients in $pp$ Collisions with a 120 GeV Beam Energy


This is the slides presented at [APS-DNP-2023](https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/HAW23/Session/E11.5) meeting. In this presentation, we demonstrate how we can use U-Nets to make corrections to the detector-level data.
