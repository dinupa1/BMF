The Drell-Yan dilepton angular distribution is a valuable tool for unraveling the structure of hadrons.
For example, the $\cos2\phi$ dependence of the angular distribution can be used to extract the Boer-Mulders (BM) function,
which characterizes the net polarization of quarks within an unpolarized proton.
The BM function captures the presence of a handedness phenomenon within the proton and represents a quark distribution
that quantifies a specific spin-orbit correlation. Conventional methods for extracting the angular coefficients typically
involve unfolding low-dimensional detector data, which may not fully exploit the complete phase space for optimal
parameter optimization. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel approach utilizing Neural Network-based Classifiers to
directly extract the angular coefficients using high-dimensional information from the detector level. In this presentation,
we will explain the design of the neural network architecture, training strategies, and outline our plans to achieve conclusive results.
