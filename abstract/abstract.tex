% The Drell-Yan dilepton angular distribution is a valuable tool for unraveling the structure of hadrons.
% For example, the $\cos2\phi$ dependence of the angular distribution can be used to extract the Boer-Mulders (BM) function,
% which characterizes the net polarization of quarks within an unpolarized proton.
% The BM function captures the presence of a handedness phenomenon within the proton and represents a quark distribution
% that quantifies a specific spin-orbit correlation. Conventional methods for extracting the angular coefficients typically
% involve unfolding low-dimensional detector data, which may not fully exploit the complete phase space for optimal
% parameter optimization. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel approach utilizing Neural Network-based Classifiers to
% directly extract the angular coefficients using high-dimensional information from the detector level. In this presentation,
% we will explain the design of the neural network architecture, training strategies, and outline our plans to achieve conclusive results.

Study of angular distributions in the Drell-Yan process is a valuable
tool for unraveling the structure of hadrons. Measuring the $\cos2\phi$ angular
dependence can be used to extract the Boer-Mulders (BM) function, which
describes the transverse-polarization asymmetry of quarks in an
unpolarized hadron. The BM function is a result of the coupling between
transverse momentum and transverse spin of the quarks inside the hadron.
Conventional methods for extracting the angular-distribution coefficients
typically involve unfolding low-dimensional detector data, which may not fully exploit the
complete phase space for best parameter optimization. To overcome
this limitation, we propose a novel approach utilizing Neural Network-based
Classifiers to directly extract the angular coefficients using high-dimensional
information at the detector level. In this presentation,
we will explain the design of the neural network architecture, training
strategies, and outline our plans to achieve conclusive results.
